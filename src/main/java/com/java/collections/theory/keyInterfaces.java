Interfaces will always provide more info compared to classes -- classes are just dummy implementations of Interface. Always look for Interface definition!

9 key Interfaces in Collection framework

1. Collection:

   when you want to represent group of objects into single entity use this interface
   most common methods used in all other collection interfaces --> add, remove, search and check if empty collection or not etc

   this can be considered as root interface of collection framework

   collection vs collections?

   --> collections is utility class present in java.util.package to define several utility methods like sorting, searching etc on Collection Objects

2. List:

   When duplicate elements allowed & insertion order is important go for List interface

   Collection [parent interface] --> List [child interface] --> implemented classes for List interface are:

   1. Array List
   2. Linked List
   3. Vector [parent utility class] --> 4. stack [child class]


3. Set:

   When we don't need duplicate and insertion order is not required -- go for Set interface
   Collection [parent interface] --> Set [child interface] --> implemented classes for Set interface are:

   1. HashSet [parent class] --> 2. linkedHashSet [child class]
